Here's a summary of what we've done and what needs to be fixed regarding the Tailwind CSS setup:

### What's Been Done
1. Created a new React + TypeScript project with Vite
2. Installed dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer react-toastify @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
   ```
3. Created configuration files:
   - `tailwind.config.js`
   - `postcss.config.js`
4. Added Tailwind directives to `src/index.css`
5. Implemented all components with Tailwind classes

### Current Issues
1. Tailwind CLI tool installation failed with error:
   ```
   npm ERR! could not determine executable to run
   ```
2. The dark mode styles in `index.css` might conflict with our Tailwind setup

3. This attempt also failed:

❯ npx --package tailwindcss@latest tailwindcss init -p
sh: 1: tailwindcss: not found

guess-the-word-game on  main via  v18.19.1 on ☁️  ttc (us-east-1) 
❯

But it could have been because of a directory issue.

### To Fix in Next Session
1. Remove the existing node_modules and package-lock.json:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   ```

2. Clean install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm install -D tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest
   ```

3. If the Tailwind CLI still fails, try installing it globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g tailwindcss
   ```

4. Clean up `src/index.css` by removing the default Vite styles (keep only):
   ```css
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;
   ```

5. Make sure the content paths in `tailwind.config.js` are correct:
   ```js
   content: [
     "./index.html",
     "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
   ],
   ```

6. Remove `App.css` if it exists since we're using Tailwind exclusively

7. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Expected Result
After these fixes:
- Tailwind classes should be properly processed
- The app should have a light theme by default
- Components should be styled according to their Tailwind classes
- No conflicts between default Vite styles and Tailwind

If issues persist after these steps, we can try:
1. Checking the Vite configuration
2. Verifying PostCSS setup
3. Looking for any CSS import order issues in the main entry files
